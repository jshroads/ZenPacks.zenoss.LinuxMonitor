    <section>
      <p>This ZenPack demonstrates the Secure Shell (SSH)
        features, and enables modeling and monitoring
        several types of device components for devices placed in the
        <filepath>/Server/SSH/Linux</filepath> device class by running commands
        and parsing the output. Parsing of command output is performed on the
        <ph conkeyref="names/platform"/> server or on a distributed collector. The
        account used to monitor the device does not require root access or special
        privileges.</p>
